# Tools_For_Data_Science
This is the repo of my IBM course final project : Tools for data science

**Exercise 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook**

Create a new Jupyter notebook called `DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`.

#### Exercise 2: Create markdown cell with title of the notebook

Create a markdown cell with the title `Data Science Tools and Ecosystem` using `H1` style heading.

Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as `2-title.png`.

#### Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction

Write an introductory sentence about the notebook such as the follows:
`In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.`

Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as `3-intro.png`.

<img width="650" alt="3-intro" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/24ccadcc-773a-49c8-bb54-1eedc7273c6b">

#### Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages

Start the cell with an overview line such as:
`Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:`
Then create an `ordered list` (i.e. numbered) listing 3 (or more) commonly used languages for data science.

Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as` 4-dslanguages.png`.

<img width="650" alt="4-dslanguages" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/50104730-b1d4-4edd-bf75-78903be9e933">

#### Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries
Add an overview line to the cell like:
`Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:`
Below this line add an `ordered list` listing 3 (or more) commonly used libraries in data science.

Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as `5-dslibraries.png`.

<img width="650" alt="5-dslibraries" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/2f3d28bc-6732-4b2e-b1e4-27d449acd4b9">

#### Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools
Create a single column table in this cell with the first row containing the header `Data Science Tools`. The subsequent three rows in the table should indicate three development environment open source tools used in data science.

Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as `6-dstools.png`.

<img width="650" alt="6-dstools" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/174bfb25-f170-407c-8039-64947b0fbb52">

#### Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples
Add a line in this cell with H3 style heading with text like:
`Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python`.

Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as `7-introarithmetic.png`.

<img width="650" alt="7-introarithmetic" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/358e92ec-726c-446b-9ac0-1744ecaaf5b7">

#### Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers
In this code cell evaluate the expression `(3*4)+5`.
Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation e.g.  `This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers`.
Then execute the cell to ensure the expression returns the expected output of `17`.

Take a screenshot of the code cell with output and name it as `8-multiplyandaddintegers.png`.

<img width="650" alt="8-multiplyandaddintegers" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/0ace23a6-a8b6-499a-b97f-dc3f763671f1">

#### Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours
In this code cell write an expression that converts `200 minutes` into `hours`.
Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation e.g.  `This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60`.
Run the cell to evaluate the expression.

Take a screenshot of the code cell with output and name it as `9-hourstominutes.png`.

<img width="650" alt="9-hourstominutes" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/30c208ad-3706-4585-b8a8-ac6b53df3459">


#### Exercise 10 - Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives
Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: `Objectives:` in bold font. Then using an `unordered list` (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as `List popular languages for Data Science`.
Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as `10-objectives.png`.

<img width="650" alt="10-objectives" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/55a61a9d-1f01-465c-aa5c-da2ade466826">

#### Exercise 11 - Create a markdown cell to indicate the Author's name
In this markdown cell markdown cell include the following text `Author` in `H2 style heading`. Include your `name` as regular text below the word Author.

Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as `11-authordetails.png`.

<img width="650" alt="11-authordetails" src="https://github.com/viktoriussuwandi/Tools_For_Data_Science/assets/68414300/9fd971f8-452a-4f7e-bb4f-0913cdd47f69">

#### Exercise 12 - Share your notebook through GitHub
Upload your notebook to a public respository on GitHub.
```
Note : Please keep the GitHub repo link of the notebook handy.
You will need to submit this link as a part of the assignment evaluation.
```
#### Exercise 13 -Take a screenshot of the first page of the notebook and save it as 1-notebook.png(Images can be saved with either the .jpg or .png extension.)
Congratulations on completing this project. In a subsequent item in the course you will submit a link to your notebook on GitHub and evaluate your peers.
